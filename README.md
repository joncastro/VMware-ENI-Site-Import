# VMware-ENI-Site-Import

#This python script is to help VMware SD-WAN customers who want to automatically import all of their SD-WAN edges as sites into VMware Edge Network Intelligence. In addition to the python script you will need a VMware Cloud Orchestrator (VCO) API token. If you have an existing VCO API Token you can use that or you will need to generate an API token. See details for how to create one in the VMware SD-WAN documentation [here](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SD-WAN/4.5/VMware-SD-WAN-Administration-Guide/GUID-6FD34A03-BDB0-4E7D-A171-9FB421566FF3.html). You will also need the URL for the VCO. The output of the script will be a CSV file that contains the all SD-WAN edges for the enterprise in a format that can be uploaded to VMware Edge Network Intelligence (ENI) to create sites. In the ENI portal, go to My Account > Admin Settings > Sites. The Sites page appears, click the action button and select upload CSV.
